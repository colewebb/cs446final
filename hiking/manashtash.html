    <h2>Manastash Ridge</h2>
    <p>
      Descending west from the top of Quartz Mountain, Manastash Ridge Trail, generally follows the top of Manastash Ridge, sharing the area with motorized and other users. 
      As a hiker, you'll wander up and down along small knobbed outcrops on this ridge, enjoying views all around. 
      Upon reaching Mount Clifty, the trail drops and contours around the cliffs on this mountain.
      Then, between Clifty and Blowout Mountain, there are approximately three crossings of recently built roads along the ridgeline to Blowout Mountain, where it contours on a bench on the north side of the mountain 
      to the end of the trail at the junction with the Blowout Mountain Trail.- Washington Trails Association
