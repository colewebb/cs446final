      eGuide grew out a simple premise: there is no good, single place to find information 
      about attractions and locations in Ellensburg. While Google Maps supplied some suggestions, 
      there are many good places to enjoy that can't be found there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so when we were looking for a problem to solve for Tatiana Harrison's CS446 class, 
      we settled on this: a compendium of local knowledge, built for the use of CWU students 
      by CWU students.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so we prototyped: and that's all this is, a prototype. Enjoy it for what it is worth, 
      but remember that it is incomplete.

      Thank you for your attention, and happy travels!
